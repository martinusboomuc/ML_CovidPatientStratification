# Machine Learning for COVID-19 Patient Stratification  

This repository contains the **code, report, and visualizations** for the **Machine Learning model** designed to assess COVID-19 patient risk using **ECG images and tabular medical data**.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to develop an **integrated Machine Learning model** for COVID-19 patient stratification, leveraging **feature selection, clustering, and classification** to assist in medical decision-making.  

## Available Files  
- **`CovidML.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.  
- **`Project-AC-2024154464.pdf`** – Report detailing methodology, implementation, and results.  
- **`images/`** – Contains visualizations related to data distribution, model performance, and clustering analysis.  

 **The dataset is NOT provided in this repository** due to privacy and licensing restrictions.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy**  
- **TensorFlow, Keras**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
